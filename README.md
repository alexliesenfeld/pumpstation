## What is PumpStation?
PumpStation is the audio effect plugin that puts creative power at your fingertips, letting you draw your own volume modulation curves. Craft intriguing audio effects with ease, from simulated sidechain compression to rhythmic tremolo, precise ducking, seamless gating, or stutter effects â€” the possibilities are vast.

PumpStation has been primarily developed for quick and easy sidechain compression without the limitation of being stuck with factory presets. It lets you precisely control how volume modulation is applied to the audio signal.
